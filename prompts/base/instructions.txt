Extract the main features out of the provided assembly function. Answer only in the JSON format following the template schema provided. Explain
what groups of instruction achieve in the source assembly succinctly, using the least amount of words possible. Provide
the address or range of addresses for the feature you describe as keys to the JSON table. You can add as many entries in the table as needed,
making sure that all features are explained in a single entry. Minimize the overlap between features and address ranges, by making sure
that every new entry in the table adds to the knowledge base, such that no features are repeated for a same address range. All your explanations must
point out to some feature that the assembly code contains. Examples: XOR chain, Prime verification routine, Call software interrupt, etc.
